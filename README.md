# EvoSkeleton
This is the project website containing relevant files for the CVPR 2020 paper "Cascaded Deep Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation with Evolutionary Training Data". The usage and instructions are organized into several parts serving distinct purposes. Please visit the corresponding sub-page for details. 

News:

(2021-04-05): A new release is planned on or before 2021-04-12. More pre-trained models will be added. MPJPE for each specific action will be added in the arxiv paper for reference.

## Hierarchical Human Representation and Data Synthesis
[This sub-page](https://github.com/Nicholasli1995/EvoSkeleton/blob/master/docs/HHR.md) gives instructions on how to use the 3D skeleton model and how the evolution algorithm can be used to discover novel data.

## Cascaded 2D-to-3D Lifting 
[This sub-page](https://github.com/Nicholasli1995/EvoSkeleton/blob/master/docs/TRAINING.md) details how to train a cascaded model to lift 2D key-points to 3D skeletons.

If you do not want to prepare synthetic data and train the model by yourself, you can access an examplar pre-trained model [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/158oCTK-9Y8Bl9qxidoHcXfqfeeA7qT93/view?usp=sharing) and follow the inference section in the [document](https://github.com/Nicholasli1995/EvoSkeleton/blob/master/docs/TRAINING.md).

## Dataset: Unconstrained 3D Pose in the Wild
[This sub-page](https://github.com/Nicholasli1995/EvoSkeleton/blob/master/docs/DATASET.md) describs the newly collected dataset Unconstrained 3D Human Pose in the Wild (U3DPW) and gives instructions on how to download it.

## Interactive Annotation Tool
[This sub-page](https://github.com/Nicholasli1995/EvoSkeleton/blob/master/docs/ANNOTATOR.md) provides usage of an annotator that can be used to label 2D and 3D skeleton for an input image. U3DPW was obtained created with this tool and this tool may help increasing the scale of 3D annotation for in-the-wild images.
